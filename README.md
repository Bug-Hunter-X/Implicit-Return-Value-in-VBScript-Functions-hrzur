This example demonstrates an uncommon error in VBScript related to implicit return values in functions. When a function does not explicitly assign a value to its name, and the code execution path does not go through the branch that performs such assignment, it results in an unexpected behavior.  The solution showcases the importance of explicitly assigning a return value in all code paths for robust and predictable function behavior.
